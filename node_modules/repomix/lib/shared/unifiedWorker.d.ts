/**
 * Unified Worker Entry Point
 *
 * This module serves as a single entry point for all worker types in Repomix.
 * It enables full bundling support by allowing the bundled file to spawn workers
 * using itself (import.meta.url), eliminating path resolution issues.
 *
 * When running as a worker, it dynamically imports the appropriate worker handler
 * based on the workerType specified in workerData.
